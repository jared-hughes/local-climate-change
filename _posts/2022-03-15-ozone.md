San Diego County is failing the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). As of 2019, the EPA reclassified San Diego County from Moderate to Serious on the ozone air quality scale [[2]](#source-2)

Even a decade ago, the state ozone standard was exceeded 16% of days over 90 degrees. [[1]](#source-1)

## What this means for you

- Ozone constricts muscles in the airways, causing wheezing and shortness of breath [[3]](#source-3)
- Ozone makes the lungs more susceptible to infection
- Higher risk of respiratory illness (asthma, emphysema, and more) [[3]](#source-3)

## How you can stay safe

- Reference the air quality index (AQI) from [airnow.gov](//airnow.gov) to know when increased pollutants are in the air
- Reference EPAâ€™s Air quality guide to understand what AQI numbers mean for you [[3]](#source-3)
