- Heat waves, by far, claim more lives than all other weather related events and disasters.
- Heat waves are expected to increase in frequency, magnitude and duration in San Diego over the next 50 years [[1]](#source-1)

The following figure from [[1]](#source-1) assumes the A2 warming model, nearby in Miramar. This is one of the worst case models, but it demonstrates how these changes will worsen within our lifetimes, even in the next few decades.

## What this means for you

- Heat-based discomfort
- Greater costs to keep cool
- More days where it is uncomfortable to go out

## How you can stay safe

- Drink enough water, especially on hot days
- Keep your home cool, using drapes, insulation, attic fans, and air conditioning
- If you do not have air conditioning in your home, find somewhere cool you can be during the warmest hours of the days on a heat wave [[2]](#source-2)
