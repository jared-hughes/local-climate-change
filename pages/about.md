A lot of discussion about climate change is focused on global issues without attention to local details. This web page is to bring information about local effects of climate change in the San Diego area, to make the issue more understandable to many people.

Most people believe that climate change is real, but treat it as something that only happens to "others" â€” distant in time (only grandchildren will be affected) or space (people in other countries). It helps to make the issues feel more relevant by bringing examples on how it will affect people specifically.
